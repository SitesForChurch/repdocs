## When do I get paid:

The first $80 will be paid when you've finished the setup steps and the site is live.  Subsequent payments will come on the one year anniversary if the client decides to continue with our service.

## Pay Scale: 

For every site you've set up and manage, you will receive a base pay of **$80 per site per year**.    

There are ways to make more than $80 for each site with... 

### Powerups: 

We want you to know what you are doing and to do a good job for the client.  To incentivize that, we will give you **$5 more per site per year** for each of the following courses you complete: (These must be done in order - please send a screenshot of your "badge" when it's complete.)

* [How to make a website](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website) (Treehouse course)
* [Build a blog with jekyll and github pages](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-blog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages) (Treehouse course)
* [CSS to Sass](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-to-sass) (Treehouse course)

**Note:** Treehouse is an online learning platform.  It costs $25 a month with no annual commitment and the first month is free.  We do not pay for this service, but we highly recommend it.


### Sales Bonuses


Another way to increase what you make per site is through sales bonuses.  If we assign you a client that comes through our website or through advertising, you'll be given the normal rate for that client, but if you bring in a client yourself, you'll get a **$10 a year sales bonus for that site**, and you get the site automatically assigned to you.
