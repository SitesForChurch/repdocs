**Welcome to the Sitesfor.church site reps program.**  We are constantly working on improving this documentation to make it easier for you to set up sites, work with clients, help churches and make money.  

## Recommendations 

### Before your first project:

We recommend that you read through this documentation in order and watch all of the videos at least once before you do your first site.  The first time you go through this, it would be a good idea to watch the videos on an iPad or second laptop so you can work along in Nitrous.  

### On every project:

Its also a good idea to keep [the Setup Guide](http://localhost:8000/setting-up/) open in a separate tab as you work on every project so you can reference the ten steps.

## Feedback

If you have any ideas for improving this - please pass them along to Ryan via the [slack channel](#).
