If you are going to do this, you'll need the right tools.  Just follow these four steps and you'll be good to go...

# Accounts

No matter how you choose to work, you'll need to have these three accounts set up:

## 1. Get a Github account.

## 2. Get an Airtable account.

## 3. Get a Nitrous account.

## 4. Get a Slack account.

# Quickstart (Nitrous)

For most people, we recommend using Nitrous.  Just by pressing the button below, you'll get a development environment in the cloud with all of the tools you need installed and the files already ready to go.  

You can also use Nitrous to collaborate - when you need help Ryan or Alex can jump on with you and you can watch them code in real time on your screen. To use Nitrous for the first time, just **PRESS THE BUTTON BELOW.**

> At any point - you can run `Run > Start Server` and then `Preview > 30000`


# Working Locally (Advanced Users Only)

Nitrous offers all the tooling you need to get started as a site-rep with sitesfor.church.  You'll never need anymore more than Nitrous, so the rest of this is **strictly optional**.  

After you have done several sites, you may want to move your process from the cloud to your own computer.  The steps for that will vary based on what kind of computer you have.  Ryan Hayden will help you with that.
