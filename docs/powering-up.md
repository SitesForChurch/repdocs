## What this is all about

In this section, we plan on posting articles and documents that will help you continuously improve as a site rep. It's a little bare right now.  I'm working on a couple of articles that will be out soon: 

* The welcome page - California theme tutorial.
* The welcome page - New England theme tutorial.
* Working with client logos and images.
* Customizing colors and fonts - an in depth walk through.
