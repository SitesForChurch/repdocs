The information the client has been updating isn't connected yet.  In order to connect it, we need to get a bunch of special values - called API keys - and paste them into the correct spot in our \n_gulp \n airtable \n airtable-config.yml\n file.\n\n\nHere is how that's done:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nAirtable's API page\n and find the APP Key for each of the client's bases and replace the ones in this file:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 _gulp\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Airtable\n|           \u251c\u2500\u2500 airtable-config.yml\n\n\n\n\nTime:\n 5 Minutes\n\n\nStep 6: Set-up and push to a github repository\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where your \ngithub\n account comes into play.  Github is super geeky and super complicated - but the long and short of it is this - it gives you an easy way to store, backup, and share all of your coding projects.  There are 9 steps to this:\n\n\ni. In Nitrous, make sure that your terminal is on the \"master-theme.\"\n\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\n\nIf it says anything else besides \"master-theme,\" then copy and paste the following code into the terminal window and hit enter.\n\n\ncd ~/code/master-theme\n\n\n\n\nIf you care to know, the \ncd\n command in the terminal stands for \"change directory.\"  \n\n\n\n\nii. Sign in to your github account; and click \"new repsository.\"\n\n\nIn a new tab, open github.com; make sure you are signed in and press the big \"new repository\" button.\n\n\nNote:\n Don't let the big word \n\"repository\"\n scare you.  A repository is just a folder where your project is stored.\n\n\n\n\niii. On the next screen, give your repository a name; and click \"create repository.\"\n\n\nThe name of your repository should probably be the domain name the client has chosen.  You DON'T want to click any of the other checkboxes on this page.\n\n\niv. On the next screen, click the copy button for the second option.\n\n\n\n\nThis should copy the text in that box to your computer's clipboard.\n\n\nNow, go back to nitrous keeping a github tab open.\n\n\nv. Paste the text (that you copied from github in your last step) into the terminal in nitrous, and hit enter.\n\n\nIt will ask you for your github username and password.  Then set up your site as a github repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe aren't out of the woods yet.  There is still three more things we need to do.  These next three commands are ones you are going to be adding often.  \n\n\nvi. Paste or type \ngit add .\n into the terminal, and hit enter.\n\n\n\n\nThis command tells github that you want to add every file and folder in your project to github so that it can keep track of it.\n\n\nvii. Paste or type \ngit commit -m \"added my files\"\n into the terminal, and hit enter.\n\n\n\n\nThis command tells github that you want to commit - or take a snapshot - of all of your files as they are right now.  This may seem tedious now, but it allows you to roll back your project when you make mistakes, and it also allows other people to work on your project without messing up your code.\n\n\nLet's look at this command.  It has three parts: \n\n\n\n\ngit commit\n - This part tells github that you want to commit your files.\n\n\n-m\n - This part is shorthand that allows you to enter a short title.  If you didn't add this, it's no big deal, the terminal would just prompt you for a title. This is a little easier.\n\n\n\"added my files\"\n - Inside of the quotes you can put whatever you want. This should just be a description of what you've done since the last commit.  Because at this point, we haven't committed anything - we are just leaving a note that says this is where we added all of our files at the beginning. \n\n\n\n\nviii. Paste or type \ngit push\n into the terminal, and hit enter.\n\n\n\n\nThis will \npush\n all of your files from this computer to github.  The terminal may ask you for your github username and password again at this step.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that those last three commands \ngit add .\n , \ngit commit -m \"your message\"\n, and \ngit push\n  should be done early and often in your project.  If you have ever almost finished a research paper, only for your computer to crash, and you have not saved it - you know how much it stinks to lose work.  This will enable you to keep your code secure and to go back to any point of it.  \n\n\nIt will also let you share it with me so we can put it on our production pipeline; which brings me to...\n\n\nix. Add me as a collaborator on github.\n\n\nBack in your github repository page (on the github website), go to \nsettings\n and then \ncollaborators\n and add me as a collaborator. My github username is \npastorryanhayden\n This will enable me to pull down your code and put in our production server (which just keeps the site updating.) \n\n\n\n\nTime:\n 10 Minutes or less. (Even though there are 9 steps to this, it's actually something that you'll get so used to doing that you'll be able to do in no time at all.  I could easily set up a github repo in less than one minute.)\n\n\nStep 7: Setup the Hosting\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last major step is setting up the URLs. To do this, we use a service called \nPubstorm.\n  100% of this is done in Nitrous, in the terminal.  All you need to do is copy and paste a few commands.\n\n\nAs usual, make sure that you are in the master-theme directory in the terminal.  It should look like this - if not, type \ncd ~/code/master-theme\n.  Once this is done, it's just three simple steps:\n\n\ni. Run \nnpm install -g pubstorm\n\n\nThis installs Pubstorm's tools on the system so we can do the next step.\n\n\nii. Run \nstorm login\n\n\nThe terminal will ask for the Pubstorm username and password.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n The username for our account is \nsitesforchurch@gmail.com\n. The password will be sent to you via email.\n\n\n\n\niii. Run \nstorm init\n\n\nIt's going to ask for two things:\n\n\n\n\nThe folder the site will live in.  This will \nALWAYS\n be \n_site\n\n\nThe name of the site.  Most of the time you should use the URL the church wants without the www. or .com sections (so if the site is biblebaptistmattoon.org you would just use \nbiblebaptistmattoon\n)\n\n\n\n\niv. Run \nstorm publish\n\n\nThis will take a minute and will publish the site to \nwhatevernameyouchose.pubstorm.site\n.\n\n\nv. Copy and paste that url into the \nURL\n field of \n_config.yml\n.\n\n\n(See Step 3 or video for further explanation.). Remember to change this back to \nhttp://localhost:3000\n when testing locally.  \n\n\nTime:\n 10 Minutes or less.\n\n\nStep 8: Pass the site code off to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the site and ready to \"go live,\" it's time to pass the site off to me.  Simply...\n\n\ni. run \ngit add .\n\n\nThis adds all the files to git to be watched.\n\n\nii. run \ngit commit -m \"your message here\"\n\n\nReplace \"your message here\" with a description of your progress.  This takes a snapshot of your files now.\n\n\niii. run \ngit push\n\n\nThis command \"pushes\" the files to github so that they  can be shared.\n\n\niv. Copy the repositories URL from its page on github, and send it to me via a slack direct message.\n\n\nOn the github websites, on your repositories page, click the large green \"clone or download\" button and copy and paste the url it gives. Send that to me via a slack direct message.\n\n\n\n\nI will then clone it on the server, and set it up so that it constantly updates.  \n\n\nStep 9: Relax and Get Paid\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all of these steps are complete, you are eligible to get paid for this project. Check the \n\"Settling Up\" section of the documentation\n for how that works.\n\n\nStep 10: Continue to communicate with your client.\n\n\nJust because you've been paid and the site is live doesn't mean your job is over.  You are still the primary support contact for the client.  For more info on your responsibilities, check the \n\"following-up\" section",

Always ask if it is a good time for the pastor/contact person and then be sure to set up a better time if not.  Introduce yourself, give a brief summary of your background, and then let them know what you'll be needing from them.  Tell them that they will be getting an email from Airtable as well as one explaining how everything works.  Give them some idea of when their site will be up \nand reiterate that it's dependent on getting content from them.\n  You can create a form with all that you'll need from them in the \ncontent collection\n database and send it to them to collect things like photos, logos, collors, etc.  Lastly, and this is very important, make sure that you set up a time about a week out for a follow up call.\n\n\nCall 2 - In depth follow up call\n\n\nTime:\n\n\nAbout a week after the first call, at the time you scheduled.\n\n\nGoals:\n \n\n\n\n\nShow them progress from the site.\n\n\nAnswer any questions they may have about updating the site.\n\n\nOffer to help train people who will be updating the site.\n\n\n\n\nBetween the first and the second call you should have almost all of the setup done.  \nThe roadblock will \nalways\n be client content\n- if possible, try to go ahead with filler content while you are waiting for the client to come through on their end.  During this call, show them (via email) the progress you've made on their site and invite their feedback.  Remember, the client is always right.\n\n\nSecond, always ask if they have any questions about how to do something and offer to setup a time where you can help any volunteers who will be working with the site.\n\n\nBetween these calls and getting the site fully going - you may have to do more follow up to get content from them.  You can do this by phone, email or even from within Airtable.  Try not to nag, but let them know you need content from them.\n\n\nCall 3 - The one month follow up call.\n\n\nTime:\n\n\nAbout a month after the site goes live.\n\n\nGoals:\n \n\n\n\n\nCheckup on the site.\n\n\nRemind the client they can call you with questions or for support.\n\n\n\n\nA month or so after the site is up.
